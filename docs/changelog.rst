Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTTP Client Adaptor Interface
*****************************

The :ref:`HTTP Client Adaptor Interface <http_adaptor>` has changed completely.
This change should only affect users who implement their own adaptor or use the interface
directly, for example when implementing a custom :ref:`Credentials Loader <credentials_loader>`.

Previously, the interface required the adaptor to be a class with two methods, one for GET and one for POST,
with different semantics for both. Further, adaptors were required to handle DynamoDB errors themselves.
This was confusing, led to issues with error handling and limited its use in Credential Loaders.

The new interface is a callable which takes a :py:class:`aiodynamo.http.types.Request` and returns an awaitable
:py:class:`aiodynamo.http.types.Response`.

Both built-in adaptors still use the same interface for initialization, so no changes should be required by
most users.

Retry and Throttling Unification
********************************

Previously, aiodynamo had two very similar types to handle retrying and client side throttling:
``aiodynamo.models.ThrottleConfig`` and ``aiodynamo.models.WaitConfig``. These have been combined
into :py:class:`aiodynamo.models.RetryConfig`.

``aiodynamo.models.ThrottleConfig`` was used to configure the :py:class:`aiodynamo.client.Client`
and if you used a custom configuration, you will need to replace it with the equivalent :py:class:`aiodynamo.models.RetryConfig`
implementation.

``aiodynamo.models.WaitConfig`` was used in table-level operations such as :py:meth:`aiodynamo.client.Client.create_table`
along others to wait for the table operation to actually complete. If you used a custom wait configuration,
you will need to replace it with the equivalent :py:class:`aiodynamo.models.RetryConfig` implementation.

Credentials Loader Changes
**************************

The internal, undocumented method ``fetch_with_retry`` in :py:class:`aiodynamo.credentials.Credentials` has
been removed.
